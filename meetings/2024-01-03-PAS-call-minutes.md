# Agenda, 4 January 2024


## Open Issues, or Issues that Need Opening



*   Isaac Foster - discussion of “TEEs in your own DCs”
    *   move to next time
*   <Please add issues here.  It’s preferable to open a new Github issue in the repo, [here](https://github.com/WICG/protected-auction-services-discussion), and then put a link to it in this doc along with your name.  That way people can comment on the subject even if they can’t attend the meeting.>


## Notes

Meeting adjourned quickly because there was only one agenda topic and it was deferred until next time.
