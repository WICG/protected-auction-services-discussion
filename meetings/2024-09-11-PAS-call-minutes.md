## Agenda

### Suggest agenda items here:

- Fabian Höring [Criteo's proposal for B&A discussion at TPAC
  2024][5]{:.external}: Confirm topics for discussion at TPAC and attendance

**Note taker**: Yashaswini Kumar

### Notes

- Fabian and other Criteo members are planning to attend TPAC. Can others attend
  so we can have an in-person discussion? Would like to discuss some of the
  issues
    - Mihir: There will be no attendance from the Privacy Sandbox server folks. We
    should discuss this during regular WICG calls.
- David: Origin trial for B&A was extended to end with M129. In M130, B&A would
  be default. What should we expect?
  - Mihir: We were planning to do scale testing in January 2025. So, we need
    Chrome APIs to be available in time. M130 may be a placeholder. Origin
    trials may be independent
  - 100% availability of the Web API at M130
- David: Feature Parity between B&A functionality and Chrome API. Are they
  coming in at the same time (plumbing)
  - Mihir: Whenever we GA with B&A, there should be compatibility with Chrome
    versions to a certain extent. There will be a point in time when features
    will converge; but not soon.
  - Known features?
  - Mihir: Should take an AI to get the timeline updated.
- Fabian
  - Criteo will allocate resources to B&A End of year / whenever B&A is ready
- Yashaswini: Discuss Criteo's topics in the next WICG call?
  - Topics for Oct 9:
    - Criteo benchmarking results (Performance of triggering UDF execution
      engine privacysandbox/protected-auction-key-value-service#43 (comment))
    - Define common benchmarking methodology
